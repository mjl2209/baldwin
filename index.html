  <h1>Exploring Social Networks of the European Grand Tour</h1>

<p>This site features transcriptions of letters, telegrams and other documents sent to Dr. William Wilberforce Baldwin, an American expatriate doctor living in Florence and Rome at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Baldwin's interlocutors were a veritable who's who of Anglo-American and European arts, letters and high society, making this body of correspondence, some 3,000 letters, a treasure for cultural historians. The collection, held at the Pierpont Morgan Library and Museum in New York City, has never been digitized or published and remains largely unstudied by scholars. </p>

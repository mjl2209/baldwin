## Transcription

My dear Dr. Baldwin, 

Mrs. Astor desires me to write & ask you for “the spray & prescription”: she is troubled with white spots or pimples in her throat. Her condition, otherwise, is steadily improving. 

My Father used to tell me, as a boy, that “short reckonings make long friends.” My cheque is at your disposal whenever you please.

Faithfully yours,  W.W. Astor

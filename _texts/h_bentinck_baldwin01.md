## Transcription

Dear Doctor Baldwin,

My mother arrived on Tuesday, looking rather thin and pale, but she seems in good spirits & her voice is much improved.  Dr. Kidd saw her yesterday and he recommends her to go on taking your medicine when the effects of the influenza are quite passed off. He quite agrees with you as to her complaint.

I am feeling much better & stronger, yours sincerely,

Henry Bentinck

## Transcription

My dear Dr. Baldwin,

I was very glad to get your letter about Viareggio & thank you very much for having procured me such full & explicit information. We find ourselves admirably well off here, & comfortable in every particular so that we shall remain here for a couple of weeks longer. Waldorf is bright & well again, eats heartily, sleeps twelve or thirteen hours in the twenty four & is out according as the weather permits. It was very gratifying to us to learn of Mrs. Baldwinâ€™s improvement & Mrs. Astor joins with me in messages of cordial regard to her.

We had a letter from Mrs. Van Martin yesterday whereby we learn of a piece of tapestry she brought to your attention. Should you be conveniently passing in the neighborhood of this treasure we should be glad to take it upon her recommendation. Perhaps the man will take 400 francs, & if not we will pay his price which is 500. I should not bother you with this but that we do not expect to pass through Florence, & we believe this particular opportunity must be a great occasion. 

I mention my indebtedness to you so far as to ask you to send me a memorandum at your convenience. And so, au revoir. 

always, sincerely yours,  W.W. Astor

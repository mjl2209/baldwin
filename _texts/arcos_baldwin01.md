## Transcription

Dear Doctor Baldwin,

Your letter as forwarded to me at Venice, one of our stopping places in the perfect journey we have made of 3000 kilometers- without a contretemps- via the Tyrol Pinnacle(?), Ballon, Besancon, Perijeux to this place. 

How beautiful the world is! & how forcibly one realizes it when traveling in this ideal manner.

I am so sorry we missed seeing you before leaving, but as we have decided to become nomads(?) I hope we shall meet on our return. 

Perhaps you have gone home this summer again, & if so, I hope you have found all well- It is such happiness to be with one’s family.

The Stars & Stripes greeted me from the yachts when I opened my windows on the morning of the 4th at Venice – you had the impressive Garibaldi celebration- Here, our National Holiday pales before the stories of the bull fight season, now in full blast. Fire works music motors noise confusion & thorough enjoyment of it all- women and children even, crowd to the horrible ‘amusement,’ but customs centuries old are not easily changed.

I shall send this to Rome although certainly you are not there, but I want to thank you for your letter. 

With kind regards from my husband & myself, believe me yours very truly,  V. Woodbury Lowery de Arcos.

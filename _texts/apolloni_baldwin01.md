Dear Doctor,

Many thanks for your kind and friendly interest for me. You have been really (??) so good to me!

Reading your letters in you have written already to your friend giving me informations about the work and the author. Therefore I shall hear bye and bye or directly or indirectly.

Do they want a marble replica or a terra cotta one? If it is the terra cotta I  have just one replica ready. 

With friendly regards believe me faithfully yours,  
A Apolloni

Dear Doctor

I am told you have some friends in Rome who would like to see my studio and my works.

I would be delighted to meet them at any time they choose.

Granting(?) I am there most of the time but I think better to let me know to my house through the telephone.

Suppose you or they will telephone me in the early morning before I leave my house. I leave my house usually(?) before nine in the morning. 

With my most cordial thanks and regards, faithfully your friend, A. Apolloni

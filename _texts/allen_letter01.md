## Transcription


November 25, 1905

My Dear Doctor Baldwin,

I regret not having found you at home when I called on Thursday morning, as I wished to make to you some report of my stay at Albano, and also some acknowledgement professional and unprofessional of your services and your kindness.

At Castel Gandolfo there was a single small vacant room adjoining the household kitchen; and while, upon reaching there, I was disposed to try this for a week, the experience of a few hours made it clear that for several reasons any satisfactory arrangement would be impossible. At Albano, however, I happened upon two connecting rooms (always occupied by Dâ€™Annunzio when he is there), commanding a magnificent view of the Campagna; and I staid there two weeks very happily.

Across the street I found Frau Von Rabe; and staying in the hotel, in a visit to her mother, was Mrs. Cassin (Cassen?)[^fn1], whom I believe you very well know: so that I was not without society.

I then thought that I should make my trip to this part of Italy before winter, with the idea of returning to Rome sometime during the season. This is now the outlook; but meanwhile, may I beg you to enclose to me at your convenience a statement of my account; and, more than that, may I beg you to accept my very hearty thanks for your other kindnesses. I hope that I may later have the opportunity of making your acquaintance much better, and of finding that you care to make mine.

Sincerely Yours,  
James Lane Allen

## Transcription

My dear Dr. Baldwin,

I herewith enclose two cheques respectively francs 5,250 & francs 450, & thank you very much for the trouble you kindly took to secure me the tapestry. I will make a note of the sale you mention and think the matter over.

We are all in good health & spirits now, & expect to remain here a week or so longer, arriving in Rome, via Leghorn, during the first days of November. Waldorf looks ruddy & strong & it is difficult to think our alarm was only thirty five days ago. We have had lovely weather here which has permitted his being out a great deal.

With our best regards to you & to Mrs. Baldwin, I remain, faithfully yours,  

W.W. Astor

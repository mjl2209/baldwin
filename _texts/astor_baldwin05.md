## Transcription

My dear Dr. Baldwin,

I am obliged to trouble you again & this time about Pauline. She had, two weeks since, a slight cold & sore throat; Dr. Holland touched the throat & prescribed a salve which failed in effect. This was followed by a sore nose with yellow matter which hardened in the nostrils rendering them very sensitive & making breathing difficult. The salve referred to above was for the nose. She eats well, seems in good health, though pale, but her rest at night is seriously broken by her nose becoming choked up. My Wife surmises it may be some distemper in the blood. Will you let us have a prescription for something to apply- or would it be desirable(?) to give her the tonic of diluted iron which did Waldorf so much good? If so, please let us have the prescription for the iron. Her throat is well. Please address me here. With our best regards to you & to Mrs. Baldwin, I remain, sincerely yours,

W.W. Astor

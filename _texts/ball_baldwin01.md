My Dear Doctor,

Your warm and affectionate letter of the 12th was very welcome, I assure you; and was read with ___ well, with moist eyes at least. You can not suppose that after thirty years or more tranquil happiness- many of them the happiest of my life- surrounded by so many dear and loving friends, I could leave all without a most painful wrench- notwithstanding it was to return to the home of my childhood; or that I could soon forget that other home- the only my children have known; If you do, you are greatly mistaken. No, I cannot read the many loving letters from dear Italy and restrain the tears that will blind my eyes while they lighten my heart. But, in the words of the old song- “We may be happy yet.” And will be, as soon as we get everything in running order.

Mr. Cooper is the most sanguine man in that respect that you ever saw. He is aching to get to work, but it will be two or three months before our Studio will be ready. We tried in vain to find a ground floor- which is absolutely necessary for sculpture- but we could not; so, we decided to buy a house and convert it into a permanent Studio, which we have done, - that is the buying part of it. The house is on 17th St. and in an excellent neighborhood; but we must wait patiently for the changes to be made. We have rented a house in this beautiful town for a year at least, where there are superior public schools, and the boys are profiting by them. The Reynolds’ are domiciled not far from us, which makes it very pleasant especially for the boys. We had the jolliest gathering of the two families Christmas day! We took our Thanksgiving dinner with them, and they their Christmas with us! and you don’t know Mr. Reynolds if you think for a moment that it was a very solemn affair- or, indeed, a very silent one with seven boys to assist in the celebration! The health and happiness of all our Florence friends, individually and collectively, was drunk. The day was perfect; but the next day we were visited by quite a heavy snow-storm!- that is, it would have been in Italy.- the snow fell to the depth of 2 ½ inches; quite enough for the boys to try their gift sleds. We have had, so far, a most remarkable Winter! I believe you have had as much cold weather as we have; which is fortunate for us, as it lets us down easy. I saw, pass, the other morning, the first sleigh that I have seen for thirty two years. We all made a rush for the windows, and saluted it with enthusiastic applause! When the snow is a little deeper, I will give the children- Mrs. Cooper included- their first sleigh-ride. 

I am awfully sorry to learn that you have been under the weather with rheumatic twinges. Now, I am not about to quote the familiar words “Physician, etc.” because I think that if you took as good care of yourself as you do of others, you would be cured; and I trust you will begin at once. I think the voyage next Summer will set you up again. But, as for leaving Florence for good, after so many years- knowing what I have suffered from so doing- I shrink from advising you. We shall all hope to see you next Summer. Can you not bring Mrs. Baldwin with you? I hope that she and the children are all well. Tell the children- Fritz in particular- not to forget me. Give my love to dear Mrs. Travers Cox and Mr. Venables. Remember me kindly to the “Committee men” and tell them to do the right thing by and for the little Church; if they do not, I shall be after them. 

With much love to Mrs. Baldwin, yourself and the children, in which Mr. and Mrs. Cooper heartily join me, I remain

Very truly yours,

Thomas Ball

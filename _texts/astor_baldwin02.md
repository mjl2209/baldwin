## Transcription

My dear Dr. Baldwin, 

We expect to leave Rome, en route to the lakes, in about a fortnight. My Wife insists upon my troubling you to know whether we can rest a day & two nights in Florence without certain death, & what part of the city you consider to be the least pestilential.
    
Mrs. Astorâ€™s health is decidedly improved, but I am anxious you should see her about these everlasting headaches.

With great regard, always,

faithfully yours,  W.W. Astor
